# Dual-Port-RAM
SRAM stands for Static Random Access Memory, a type of RAM that stores data as long as power is supplied: 
 
How it works: SRAM uses transistor baesd latching circuitry to store each bit of data. This design allows SRAM to retain data indefinitely if the device is powered. 
 
Performance: SRAM performs better and uses less power than Dynamic RAM (DRAM), which needs to be continuously refreshed. 
 
Cost and space: SRAM is more expensive and requires more space than DRAM. 

The term "static" in its name comes from the fact that no action is needed to keep the data intact.
